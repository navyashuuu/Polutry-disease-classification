#### 🚀 Project Highlights

* 🤖 **Model**: Deep learning with `MobileNetV2` (TensorFlow/Keras)
* 🖼️ **Input**: Fecal images of poultry in four classes:

  * 🟢 Healthy
  * 🧫 Coccidiosis
  * 🧪 Salmonella
  * 🦠 Newcastle Disease
* 📊 **Dataset**: Organized via CSV + ZIP with labeled image folders
* ⚙️ **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, label encoding
* 🏗️ **Training**: Fine-tuned on augmented dataset for higher accuracy
* 🌐 **Deployment**: Flask-based web app with real-time predictions
* 💻 **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS interface for file upload & result display
* 🧪 **Evaluation**: Accuracy, loss, and classification report for performance
